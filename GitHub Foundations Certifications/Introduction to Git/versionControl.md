# What is _version control_?
-  program or set of programs that tracks change to a collection of files.
- also called a software configuration management (**SCM**) system. 

### Advantages
- See all changes made to the project, when the changes were made, and who made them.
- Retrieve past versions of the entire project or of individual files.
- Create *branches*, where changes can be made experimentally which allows different set of changes to be worked on at the same time, possibly by different people, without affecting the main branch. This can later be merged into the main branch. 

#### Terminology
Working Tree: set of nested directories and files that contain the project that's being worked on.
